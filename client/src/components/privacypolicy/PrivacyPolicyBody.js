          Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your computer when you visit some websites. They do not harm your computer, instead they are used to analyse the way you use the internet, and can personalise websites to suit your preferences. The cookies we use are Google Analytics (in which all user data is anonymous) which allows us to credit the website that brought you to rosegarden.com). If you click on a link in an email from us or around our site, we may set a cookie on your browser. If you visit our website as a result of clicking on a link, we are thus able to understand how you interact with the pages of our Website through the combination of the cookie and pixels set (on the pages of our website). This enables us to understand what interested you in our emails and what did not, and what interests you about our Website and what does not. We can then try to send you more interesting information in the future. If you do not wish this to happen, you can change the cookie settings in your browser (however you will then be unable to use our website for shopping purposes). Please note that this information is for our use only; we do not disclose or share this information with any third parties.
